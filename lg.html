                    <p>LG has finally called it quits to its smartphone business and seeing how the company struggled to make its presence felt over the year, this doesn’t come as a surprise.
                      LG has a history of launching flagships, mid-range, and budget offerings. Though it started strong, the brand had somehow lost its way in an effort to compete with giants like Apple,
                      Samsung, Huawei as well as aggressively priced smartphones from Chinese brands like Xiaomi, OnePlus, and Realme. LG is remembered for launching several innovative phones over the years.
                      Sadly, it couldn’t convert them into actual sales mainly because the phones lacked the polish that one would desire after paying a premium.</p>
